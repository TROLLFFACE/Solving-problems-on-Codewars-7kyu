Write a function that takes a positive integer n, sums all the cubed values from 1 to n (inclusive), and returns that sum.

Assume that the input n will always be a positive integer.

Examples: (Input --> output)

2 --> 9 (sum of the cubes of 1 and 2 is 1 + 8)
3 --> 36 (sum of the cubes of 1, 2, and 3 is 1 + 8 + 27)

my answer
def sum_cubes(n):
    a = 0
    for i in range(n):
        a += n ** 3
        n-=1
    return a
